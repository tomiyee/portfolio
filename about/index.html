        <h1>Passions</h1>
        <p>
          In short, I have three core passions: software development, machine
          learning, and education.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Software Development</h2>
        <p>
          This should go without saying, but I enjoy building software. I had
          grown up loving to build and assumble furniture from Ikea with my
          sisters, folding origami, and making homemade ice-cream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, I just loved putting something together, looking at the
          final product, and being able to say I made that.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, growing up with limited resources, I wasn't really able to
          explore building something "useful" in the physical world aside from
          the rare piece of Ikea furniture. Thus, I looked to software development
          which was free for anyone with a computer to explore and learn if
          they're willing to do some googling.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          In the summer of 2017, before my Senior year of high-school, I took
          part in an internship program at Stanford through their RISE program,
          where I developed a time-series forecasting LSTM Neural Network for
          the Stanford Autonomous Systems Laboratory.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first time using Github, Python, Tensorflow, and Keras.
          I was provided with links to online resources for the introductory
          machine learning classes and self-studied some basic background in
          linear algebra and beginning concepts like back-propogation and mean
          squared erorr. I was so inspired by my readings that I continued to
          learn how to develop AI models of my very own.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of Spring 2020, I have completed MIT's Introduction to Machine Learning
          class (6.036), and have completed four semesters of undergraduate
          research under the MIT Computer Science and Artifial Intelligence
          Laboratory (CSAIL).
        </p>
        <h2>3. Education</h2>
        <p>
          One of my core values is to do anything that I can to help others. For
          me, this makes the field of education especially rewarding. Many of my
          early volunteer work and internships involved leading after-school or
          summer programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even recently, I've done undergraduate research and software development
          for the visual coding platform MIT App Inventor during the semester at
          CSAIL, as well as lead presentations and classes teaching programming to
          children and adults alike.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          I have experience in a variety of programming environments, but I began
          with developing webpages when I was in middle school, albeit not
          visually appealing websites. As a result, my "mother tongue" of coding
          languages is Javascript, with HTML and CSS. I am very familiar with
          other programming languages like Python, C/C++, and Java, in order of
          decreasing familiarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first large project was a website that allowed other middle schoolers
          to practice their arithmetic online, which in hindsight closely resembled
          Khan Academy (in goal, no where near in visuals or functionality). It
          simply generated a set of random problems of varying difficulty, like
          a set of simple multiplication problems, or simple equations to solve
          for x.
